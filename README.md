# HomeLab
This repository is dedicated to my home lab creation. Originally, the plans for this project was to create a fully on-premise homelab, but I decided it was time to get familiar with Docker and apply my cloud knowledge (as validated with my certifications).

# Goals and Objectives
Goals and Objectives for Docker and VM Homelab Project
1. Infrastructure Setup and Networking:
Goal: Configure a networked environment that includes Docker containers and VMs.
Objectives:
Set up a Docker host on your PC.
Create virtual networks in Docker and configure connectivity between Docker containers and VMs.
Establish network segmentation and VLANs for different services and applications.
2. Containerization with Docker:
Goal: Gain proficiency in deploying and managing applications using Docker containers.
Objectives:
Containerize essential services such as web servers (e.g., Nginx), databases (e.g., MySQL), and monitoring tools (e.g., Prometheus, Grafana).
Learn Dockerfile creation for custom application containers.
Explore Docker Compose for multi-container applications and orchestration.
3. Virtualization with VMs:
Goal: Understand the principles of virtualization and manage VMs in your homelab environment.
Objectives:
Install a hypervisor (e.g., VMware Workstation, VirtualBox) on your PC.
Create VMs for hosting critical infrastructure services (e.g., Domain Controller, file server).
Configure networking and resource allocation for VMs.
4. Integration and Hybrid Environment:
Goal: Integrate Docker containers and VMs for a hybrid environment that mirrors real-world scenarios.
Objectives:
Deploy applications spanning both Docker containers and VMs to simulate hybrid cloud deployments.
Implement load balancing and high availability concepts using Docker Swarm or Kubernetes for containers.
Explore VM migration and disaster recovery scenarios within the homelab setup.
5. Monitoring and Security:
Goal: Implement monitoring and security best practices across Docker containers and VMs.
Objectives:
Set up monitoring tools such as Prometheus and Grafana to monitor container and VM performance.
Implement security measures including network segmentation, firewall rules, and container security best practices.
Conduct vulnerability assessments and apply patches and updates to Docker containers and VMs.
